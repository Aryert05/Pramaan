## About

**Pramaan** is a comprehensive full-stack web application built with JavaScript. The project showcases a clean separation of concerns with dedicated frontend and backend directories, enabling scalable and maintainable code architecture.

## Project Structure

```
Pramaan/
├── frontend/          # React/Vue.js frontend application (89% JavaScript, 10.8% CSS, 0.2% HTML)
├── backend/           # Node.js backend server
└── README.md          # This file
```

### Frontend
The frontend directory contains the user interface built with modern JavaScript frameworks and styling with CSS. It provides an interactive and responsive experience for users.

### Backend
The backend directory houses the server-side application logic, API endpoints, and data management functionality.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaScript (89%), CSS (10.8%), HTML (0.2%)
- **Backend**: Node.js / JavaScript
- **Language**: JavaScript (primary language)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aryert05/Pramaan.git
   cd Pramaan
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The frontend application will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is occupied).

### Running the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

The backend server will start on the configured port (typically `http://localhost:5000` or `http://localhost:8000`).

### Running Both Concurrently

From the root directory, you can set up scripts to run both frontend and backend simultaneously:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Development

### Frontend Development
- Modify files in the `frontend/` directory
- Changes typically hot-reload during development
- Follow JavaScript/CSS best practices

### Backend Development
- Modify files in the `backend/` directory
- Restart the server to see changes
- Ensure all API endpoints are properly documented
